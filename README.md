# 🧠 DIME: Deep-Learning–Driven Inversion Framework for MRE  
### Author: Hassan Iftikhar  
### Model & Sample Data Release for Reproducibility

This repository contains the **trained DIME model**, along with **sample displacement fields**, **ground-truth stiffness maps**, and **notebooks** for reproducing the experiments described in the DIME paper.  
The goal of this repository is to provide transparent reproducibility for reviewers and researchers by allowing them to run the exact inference pipeline used in the manuscript.

## 📌 Overview

**DIME (Deep Image-based Modulus Estimator)** is a patch-based deep learning inversion framework for **Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE)**.  
The method takes as input:

- The **displacement field (DF)**  
- First harmonic **real** and **imaginary** components  
- Each channel is individually rescaled to **0–4095**  
- Input is fed to the model patch-by-patch  
- A full-resolution stiffness map is reconstructed  
- Results are compared against **ground truth** and **MMDI**

This repository includes:

-  `trained_model.pth` – the trained DIME network  
-  Sample datasets for each study  
-  Four fully runnable notebooks  
-  Patch-based inference modules  
-  Custom AWAVE and AAASMO colormaps  
-  Statistical evaluation (mean, SD, Excel export)  
-  Reconstruction & visualization utilities
